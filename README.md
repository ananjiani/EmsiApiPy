# EmsiApiPy
This library is designed as a helpful resource for connecting to [Emsi's APIs](https://api.emsidata.com/). It is provided as-is under no warranty by Emsi, but rather as an effort by various users to provide a centralized, coordinated way to access the APIs in an effective manner.


# Installation
Clone the repository. Install the required packages in `requirements.txt`:
```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Setup .ini File
There is a file in the repository named `permissions.ini.sample`. When the repo is cloned, it will look like this:
```
[DEFAULT]
username = foo
password = bar
```
You will need to change the `foo` and `bar` values to what was provided by the Emsi API support team, and rename the file to `permissions.ini`.


# Usage
We need to add something to this section.
